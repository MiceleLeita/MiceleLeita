# 👋 Hi, I'm Micele!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a hands-on engineering student at Florida Tech, currently contributing to the **Florida Tech Rocketry Club** and leading the **Project Vulcan senior design team**. My focus lies in turning ambitious concepts into functional hardware — from machined components to experimental propulsion systems — with a strong emphasis on manufacturability, precision, and system-level integration.

## 🚀 Projects Showcase

Explore some of my technical work below, with full writeups available in the [Projects repository](https://github.com/MiceleLeita/Projects):

- 💍 [Aluminum Ring](https://github.com/MiceleLeita/Projects/tree/main/ring_project)  
  Machined from raw aluminum using a manual lathe and bandsaw. Created as part of Florida Tech’s machine shop certification and Rocketry Club training initiative.

- 📐 [GD&T Block](https://github.com/MiceleLeita/Projects/tree/main/block_project)  
  Precision-machined component fabricated using a Bridgeport mill and technical drawings. Emphasis on GD&T interpretation and tolerance control. Also completed through the Rocketry Club.

- 🔥 [Compact Turbojet Engine](https://github.com/MiceleLeita/Projects/tree/main/turbojet_engine) *(In Progress)*  
  A miniaturized turbojet designed and built through the Florida Tech Rocketry Club, featuring combustion analysis, turbine integration, and CAD modeling.

- ⚡ [3D Printed Ion Engine](https://github.com/MiceleLeita/Projects/tree/main/ion_engine) *(In Progress)*  
  An experimental electric propulsion concept leveraging additive manufacturing and high-voltage ion acceleration grids.

- 🧨 [Project Vulcan](#) *(Writeup Coming Soon)*  
  Florida Tech’s **Project Vulcan senior design team** — developing a metal 3D-printed aerospike engine with a fluid-injected thrust vector control (FITVC) system, in partnership with Vaya Space.
