# 👋 Hi, I'm Micele!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a hands-on aerospace engineering student at Florida Tech, actively contributing to the **Florida Tech Rocketry Club** and leading the **Project Vulcan senior design team**. My focus lies in bridging the gap between design and manufacturing — turning complex, high-concept systems into tangible hardware through careful planning, precision fabrication, and a whole lot of machine oil.

## 🚀 Projects Showcase

Explore some of my engineering and prototyping work below. Full writeups, images, and in-progress updates are available in the [Projects repository](https://github.com/MiceleLeita/Projects):

- 💍 [Aluminum Ring](https://github.com/MiceleLeita/Projects/tree/main/ring_project)  
  A manually machined ring — created for someone special 💕 — using a lathe and bandsaw. Completed through Florida Tech’s machine shop certification and as part of Rocketry Club hands-on training.

- 📐 [GD&T Block](https://github.com/MiceleLeita/Projects/tree/main/block_project)  
  Fabricated from AL6061 using a Bridgeport mill and tapping tools. Designed and machined to spec using technical drawings with a strong emphasis on GD&T interpretation, feature precision, and tolerance control.

- 🧻 [Tape Dispenser](https://github.com/MiceleLeita/Projects/tree/main/tape_dispenser) *(In Progress)*  
  My final project for Florida Tech’s machine shop certification — currently in progress. Designed to be fully functional and robust, with all components machined by hand.

- 🔥 [Compact Turbojet Engine](https://github.com/MiceleLeita/Projects/tree/main/turbojet_engine) *(In Progress)*  
  A student-scale turbojet engine currently being designed and constructed through the Rocketry Club. Focus areas include combustion chamber design, turbine optimization, and CAD-driven fabrication planning.

- ⚡ [3D Printed Ion Engine](https://github.com/MiceleLeita/Projects/tree/main/ion_engine) *(In Progress)*  
  Experimental electric propulsion concept built using additive manufacturing and high-voltage ion acceleration grids. Just for fun — but taken seriously.

- 🧨 [Project Vulcan](#) *(Writeup Coming Soon)*  
  Florida Tech’s **Project Vulcan** senior design team — developing a 3D-printed metal aerospike engine with a fluid-injected thrust vector control (FITVC) system. Managed through Jira and integrated with Agile workflows in partnership with Vaya Space.
